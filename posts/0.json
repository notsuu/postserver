                "the reason for this website? no particular one. the thought to make it just popped up in my head during my (unsuccessful) attempt to fall asleep, so naturally i procrastinated for the whole day and realized i wanted to make the website at like 11pm",
                "either way, the design is not final, it mostly resembles my old carrd so i might change stuff here and there",
                "until then, see you in the next blog post... i hope"
