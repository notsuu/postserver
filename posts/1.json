		"welcome back to blog of a random guy on the internet, today we will be talking about an obscure game i made a while ago and that is [announcer game](https://announcer-game.notsudake.repl.co). seems like an average incremental, nothing really out of the ordinary, right?",
		"## Think again.",
		"you may be shocked by the definitely balanced gameplay with a clear goal, but have you ever considered checking the source code? because that is a **mess**, and i mean it. heres for example the achievement check function:",

  		"  //oh god.",
    		"  if (announcer.coins >= 1) achGrant(\"achievement_announce\");",

    		"(yeah, blog supports codeblocks now. groundbreaking, i know)",
    		"and this isnt even the worst bit of code ive written for this game! the update function is even more terrible, but i wont bother trying to actually paste the whole thing in here. go have a look for yourself if you really want to.",
    		"anyway, what was the whole point of this post? probably to say that im working on a new version of this game! hopefully the codebase will suck less. who knows. i might post devlogs here, might not. it probably wont be instantly publicly available because i dont want you to play an unstable, half-finished game but ill try to, well, not procrastinate like ive been doing for the past week or so",
